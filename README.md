# trim
A basic JavaScript trim function to remove lead and trail white space and control characters. For use with HTAs and older browsers that don't support the built-in `.trim()` method.

### Usage
```javascript
trim(inputString);
```

If `inputString` is not a string, an error message will be output to the console and the unchanged argument will be returned.
